🌳 Day 1: 공원(Parks) 테마 학습 정리
Q1. [Description] 자주 가는 공원 묘사
Question: Tell me about a park that you often visit. Where is it located and what does it look like? Give me a detailed description of that place.

Script: That's a good question. I’d love to tell you about my favorite park. As I mentioned, I usually visit a park right in my neighborhood.

To be specific, it’s just about a 10-minute walk from my place. The park has a well-maintained running track. You know, running is all the rage these days in Korea! When I’m stressed out, I just go there and run. Personally, I prefer going there at night because I can soak up the peace and quiet.

Well, okay Eva, I think that’s pretty much all about my favorite park.

Q2. [Routine/Detail] 공원에서의 루틴
Question: What do you usually do when you go to that park? Who do you go there with, and what is your typical routine from the moment you arrive until you leave?

Script: Well, to be honest, I usually go to the park by myself. But of course, it depends on who I’m with.

When I’m alone, I mostly listen to music and take a walk. If I go with my wife, we usually talk a lot. On the other hand, with my friends, we focus on breaking a sweat and run together. My routine is simple. First, I do some light stretching. Then, I walk or run for about an hour.

Before I head home, I always buy a bottle of water. There’s nothing like drinking cold water after a workout!

Q3. [Past Experience] 공원에서 겪은 비 소동
Question: Tell me about a memorable or unexpected incident that happened at a park. When was it, what happened, and why was it so memorable?

Script: Oh, I have a funny story about this. A few months ago, I went to the park for a run and all of a sudden, it started raining.

I thought it would stop soon, so I decided to go inside a nearby cafe. I waited for a while, but the rain just wouldn't stop. Eventually, I gave up and bought an umbrella. But here is the hilarious part. Less than five minutes later, the rain completely stopped!

I was like, 'Are you kidding me?' It was a total waste of money, but I guess it’s a funny memory now.
