🎬 Day 4: 영화 관람(Movies)
Q1. [Description] 좋아하는 영화 취향
Actually, I’m a big fan of comedy movies. I prefer something light that I can enjoy without thinking too much.

Specifically, I love movies that are funny and easy to follow. As a programmer, I deal with complex problems all day at work. So, when I watch a movie, I just want to laugh and relax my brain.

So, overall, simple and funny comedy movies are my absolute favorite.

Q2. [Routine/Detail] 영화 관람 루틴
To tell you the truth, I usually watch movies at home with my wife these days. We have a very simple routine for our movie nights.

First, before the movie starts, we always order some delivery food. Our favorite choice is usually fried chicken and beer. And then, we turn off all the lights to make it like a theater. After the movie, we usually talk about our favorite scenes before going to sleep.

So, that's my typical movie routine. It's nothing special, but it's very relaxing.

Q3. [Past Experience] Actually, I watched a movie on Netflix with my wife a few days ago. I don't remember the exact title, but it was a very funny comedy movie.

The story was about a woman. She was told that she was going to die soon. So, she decided to spend all her money and live a very fancy life.

But, the hilarious part was that she wasn't actually dying! It was just a mistake by the hospital, and it was a minor illness. It was such a heartwarming and happy ending.

Oh! Wait a second. I just remembered the title! It’s called 'Last Holiday.' You should check it out when you have time, Eva!
