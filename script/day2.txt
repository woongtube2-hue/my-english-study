📚 Day 2: 음악 감상(Music)
Q1. [Description] 좋아하는 장르와 가수
Question: What kind of music do you like? Who is your favorite singer or composer?

Script: Well, to be honest, I'm a big fan of music that boosts my mood. Whenever I listen to upbeat songs, I feel so much better and more energetic.

As you probably know, Bruno Mars is my absolute favorite artist. His songs are so catchy that I just can't stop moving my body. I also love his recent song with Lady Gaga, called 'Die With A Smile'. His voice is so captivating that it makes me focus and get lost in the music.

So, overall, these are the types of music and the artist that I’m really into these days.

Q2. [Routine/Detail] 음악을 듣는 시간과 장소
Question: When and where do you usually listen to music? What do you usually do while listening?

Script: Well, like you said, I think music is something we can enjoy anytime and anywhere. For me, I especially listen to music during my commute to work. It's the best way to boost my energy before starting my day.

Also, since I work as a programmer, I sometimes listen to music while I'm working. But, I try not to listen to music when I’m studying or reading books. Because the songs make me lose my focus. I mean, I keep listening to the words instead of reading.

Except for those times, I usually have music on all day long. That's pretty much all about my music routine.

Q3. [Past Experience] 음악과 관련된 특별한 기억
Question: Do you remember a special or memorable time when you listened to a specific song?

Script: Let me see..., I don't have a very dramatic story. But there is one song that always brings back great memories. It’s 'Just the Way You Are' by Bruno Mars.

Last year, I went on my honeymoon to Switzerland with my wife. While we were traveling, we listened to that song over and over again. The weather was perfect, and that song was the perfect background music for our trip.

Now, whenever that song comes up on my YouTube Music playlist, I feel like I am back in Switzerland. I mean, the algorithm sometimes picks that song for me, and it always reminds me of my trip. It’s definitely my favorite memory related to music.
