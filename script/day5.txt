🏃 Day 5: 조깅 및 걷기 (Jogging/Walking)
Q1. [Description] 장소 묘사
Question: Where do you usually go for jogging? Describe that place.

Script: Actually, I usually go to a local park near my apartment.
It’s not a huge park, but it’s very clean and well-maintained.

To be specific, there is a long walking trail that is perfect for jogging.
What I like most about it is the fresh air from all the trees and flowers.
During the weekends, I see many families and couples enjoying their time there.
It’s a very peaceful place, and I feel relaxed whenever I go there.

All in all, this park is my favorite spot to clear my head.

Q2. [Routine/Detail] 루틴 및 준비물
Question: When do you usually go for a walk? What do you bring with you?

Script: As I mentioned before, I try to go for a walk every evening after work.
Mainly because I sit at my desk all day as a programmer, so I really need to move my body.

Normally, I go there with my wife.
We talk about our day while walking, and it’s a great way to spend quality time together.
Before leaving, I always put on my running shoes and bring my smartphone.
Lately, I’ve been listening to English podcasts while walking to kill two birds with one stone.

In short, this evening walk is a very important part of my daily life.

Q3. [Past Experience] 특별한 경험 (비 소동)
Question: Tell me about a memorable experience you had while jogging.

Script: I can't forget the time when I went for a walk last summer.
Actually, it’s a bit of a funny story. The weather was perfectly fine when we left the house.

But out of nowhere, the sky turned dark and it started to rain cats and dogs.
We didn't have an umbrella, so we were totally panicked.
Eventually, we had to run as fast as we could all the way back home.
We were completely soaked, but it was such a hilarious and happy ending.

Looking back, it’s now a great memory that we often talk about.
That’s pretty much the whole story about my memorable experience.
