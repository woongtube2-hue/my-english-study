📅 Day 6: 가전제품 (Household Appliances) - [최종 정리]
Q1. [Description] 가전제품 묘사
Question: What kind of appliances do you have in your home? Which one do you use most often?

Script: Actually, there are two appliances I can’t live without. One is my robot vacuum, and the other is my all-in-one washer and dryer. 

First, the robot vacuum is a life-changer. I’m always busy, so I love that it cleans the floor automatically while I work. Also, my washing machine is a combo unit. It handles both washing and drying at the same time. I just press one button and it’s all done. It saves me so much time and effort.

In short, it's the most useful appliance I have, and I use it every single day.

Q2. [Comparison] 과거 vs 현재 가전제품 비교
Question: How are appliances different now compared to the past? What are the biggest changes?

Script: It’s interesting to think about how much appliances have changed over the years. 

Back then, vacuum cleaners were quite inconvenient. They were heavy, and you always had to plug them into an outlet. You had to do all the work yourself. 
On the other hand, modern appliances are incredibly smart. Like I said, we have robot vacuums now that do everything for us. What’s even better is that I can control everything using an app called 'SmartThings.' Even when I’m not at home, I can start the vacuum or the laundry with just a few taps on my phone.

Looking back, I think technology has made our lives much more convenient than before.

Q3. [Problem/Experience] 가전제품 고장/해결 경험
Question: Tell me about a time when an appliance broke down. What was the problem and how did you fix it?

Script: I remember a time when my washing machine stopped working during a very cold winter. The temperature dropped so low that the drain pipe in the balcony completely froze up. 

Out of nowhere, the machine stopped in the middle of a cycle and showed an error message. I realized that the water couldn't drain out because of the ice. I was totally panicked because it was full of wet clothes and water. 
To fix the problem, I had to manually drain the water and use hot water to melt the ice. After a few hours, I finally managed to unclog it. 

Looking back, it was a very stressful day, but I’m glad I could fix it myself. Now, I always make sure to keep the balcony warm during the winter.
